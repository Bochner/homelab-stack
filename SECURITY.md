## Security Features

This homelab stack implements several security best practices:

### Container Security
- **No-new-privileges**: All containers run with `security_opt: no-new-privileges:true`
- **Non-root users**: Services run as non-root users where possible
- **Read-only filesystems**: Critical containers use read-only root filesystems
- **Minimal capabilities**: Containers only have necessary capabilities

### Network Security
- **Isolated networks**: Services communicate over dedicated Docker networks
- **Reverse proxy**: All external access goes through Traefik with SSL
- **Internal communication**: Services communicate using internal hostnames
- **Port restrictions**: Only necessary ports are exposed

### SSL/TLS Security
- **Automatic SSL**: Wildcard SSL certificates via Cloudflare DNS challenge
- **Strong ciphers**: Modern TLS configuration with secure cipher suites
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers
- **Security headers**: Comprehensive security headers via Traefik

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Centralized auth**: Keycloak provides SSO for compatible services
- **Basic auth**: Protected admin interfaces with htpasswd
- **API tokens**: Secure API authentication where supported
- **Default credentials**: All default passwords must be changed

### Secrets Management
- **Environment variables**: Secrets stored in .env files (not committed)
- **File permissions**: Restricted permissions on configuration files
- **Docker secrets**: Support for Docker secrets in production
- **Credential rotation**: Regular rotation of API keys and passwords

### Update Security
- **Automated updates**: Watchtower provides automatic container updates
- **Dependency scanning**: GitHub Dependabot monitors for vulnerabilities
- **Image scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of container images
- **Security advisories**: Notifications for security updates

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Where to Report
Please report security vulnerabilities through one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred)
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form

2. **Email** (for sensitive issues)
   - Send to: [security@yourdomain.com]
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed description and reproduction steps

### What to Include
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix development**: Depends on severity
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is deployed

### Disclosure Policy
- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- Security fixes will be released as soon as possible
- Public disclosure will happen after fixes are available
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Initial Setup
1. **Change all default passwords** in the .env file
2. **Use strong, unique passwords** for all services
3. **Enable two-factor authentication** where supported
4. **Review firewall rules** on your server
5. **Keep the host OS updated** regularly

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Monitor security advisories** for used services
2. **Review access logs** regularly
3. **Update container images** monthly
4. **Backup configurations** and data
5. **Test disaster recovery** procedures

### Network Security
1. **Use a firewall** to restrict external access
2. **Consider VPN access** for admin interfaces
3. **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies
4. **Isolate the homelab network** from other systems
5. **Use strong DNS filtering** with Pi-hole

### Access Control
1. **Limit admin access** to necessary users only
2. **Use SSH keys** instead of passwords
3. **Disable unused services** and features
4. **Regular access review** and cleanup
5. **Log and monitor** admin activities

## Security Scanning

This repository includes automated security scanning:

### Container Image Scanning
- **Trivy**: Scans for vulnerabilities in container images
- **Docker Bench**: Checks Docker security best practices
- **Frequency**: Every push and weekly scheduled scans

### Code Scanning
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Secret detection**: Scans for accidentally committed secrets
- **Dependency review**: Checks for vulnerable dependencies

### Configuration Scanning
- **Custom audits**: Docker Compose security configuration checks
- **Best practices**: Validation of security settings
- **Policy enforcement**: Automated policy compliance checks

## Known Security Considerations

### Traefik Dashboard
- Protected by basic authentication
- Consider additional access restrictions
- Monitor access logs regularly

### Pi-hole Admin
- Web interface accessible via HTTPS
- Use strong admin password
- Consider IP-based restrictions

### Docker Socket Access
- Some services require Docker socket access
- Mounted as read-only where possible
- Monitor for privilege escalation

### SSL Certificates
- Automatic renewal via Cloudflare
- Wildcard certificates stored in Docker volumes
- Backup certificate data regularly

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident
1. **Isolate** affected systems immediately
2. **Document** the incident and timeline
3. **Notify** stakeholders as appropriate
4. **Investigate** root cause and impact
5. **Remediate** vulnerabilities
6. **Update** security measures
7. **Review** and improve procedures

### Emergency Contacts
- Primary: [admin@yourdomain.com]
- Secondary: [backup@yourdomain.com]
- External security contact: [security-vendor@example.com]
